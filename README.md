# jupyter_integrations_bootstrap
Bootstrap installs for various platforms using a common (and portable) configuration


## Config
--------
The folder integrations_config_template is an example config directory. 

This folder will be documented more completely as we go, but the recommedation is copy this to a location at your org and update this folder to work in your org. Putting in customized options for setup, and which reports will be installed. 

PROTIP: Store the config in a private or internal repo to track changes and use that in an install script depending on your bootstrap. 



## Bootstraps
-----------
There will be installs for various platforms that read the config and install the integrations as needed. 

Only windows is supported, but more will be added.
